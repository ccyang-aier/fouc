/**
 * Page-level undo coordination (B08, design §5.4/§9.3).
 *
 * One controller per open page, attached to the very Y.Doc the page
 * session (B04) owns. Everything here is local-stack machinery, so it
 * behaves identically online, mid-sync and fully offline:
 *
 * - The human stack tracks only this connection's human origin (plus
 *   editor binding origins). Peers' and agents' updates never enter it —
 *   neither remote ones (the provider applies those, and origins do not
 *   cross the wire) nor local transactions under a foreign origin — so
 *   "undo" can never revert somebody else's or an AI's writing.
 * - Each AI/MCP task origin aggregates into undo unit(s) spanning all of
 *   the task's blocks and transactions; `task(origin).undo()` reverts the
 *   whole AI task in one pass. Neither stack disturbs the other, redo
 *   stacks included.
 * - Leaving the page destroys the Y.Doc (B04); the controller reacts to
 *   that by clearing every stack and listener, and `destroy()` does the
 *   same on demand.
 *
 * A task unit only covers writes that are local to this connection's
 * document (client-driven agent writes, applied suggestions). Tasks the
 * backend writes over its own connection are remote updates here and are
 * undone through their server-side path, not from this module.
