/**
 * Decision orchestration over the S01 review API (S02, design §4.5/§9.3).
 *
 * Every accept/reject — one suggestion from a card, one from the panel, or
 * the "all" buttons — funnels through `applyReviewDecision`, which runs the
 * real `reviewSuggestions` transaction against the live editor: the decision
 * crosses the y-prosemirror binding into the page's Y.Doc and lands on the
 * B08 human undo stack of this connection as the reviewer's own edit. "All"
 * passes every outstanding suggestionId into a single S01 transaction, so
 * each suggestion stays atomic while the batch is one Yjs transaction and one
 * undo step (the semantics S01 proved); a loop of per-id transactions would
 * fragment undo and is deliberately not used.
