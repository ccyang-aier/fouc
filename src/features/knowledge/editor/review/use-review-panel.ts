/**
 * The live view of the review UI (S02) over one Tiptap instance.
 *
 * The hook owns no state of its own beyond a re-render tick: every visible
 * fact — rows, statistics, the disabled matrix, the active suggestion — is
 * derived on each editor event from the document (via `collectSuggestions`)
 * and from the review plugin's selection-derived `activeId`. That keeps the
 * panel honest under remote CRDT updates: an agent streaming in a new
 * proposal re-renders the same pass that renders it in the text.
 *
 * Actions return to the modules that own them: locate goes through
 * `selectReviewSuggestion` (caret + selection-derived state) and the scroll
 * math of `review-scroll`; accept/reject funnel through `applyReviewDecision`
 * so every decision is one S01 transaction on the B08 undo stack.
